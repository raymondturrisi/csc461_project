# csc461\_project
Repository for CSC 461 (Machine Learning) final project on Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project will use FB Research's Compiler Gym to explore deep RL techniques in optimizing LLVM code, based on code size and runtime performance. Herein this repo we so far have: 

 - testing\_c\_programs
	- Here there is a shell script to use csmith, to automatically generate c files which we will use for benchmarking. 


This project was selected as an Outstanding Project in CSC 461
